// This render pass isn't particularly informative.  It allows you to apply tonemapping on an
//     input buffer and output it into a specified output texture.  The tone mapping algorithms 
//     are not demonstrated in either this RenderPass or associated HLSL code, as this pass 
//     simply calls a Falcor utility pass that allows choosing your tonemapping algorithm from
//     one of 5 or 6 built-in options.
