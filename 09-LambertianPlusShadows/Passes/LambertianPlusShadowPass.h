// This render pass renders a scene with a simple Lambertian diffuse shading model, but
//     also shoots shadow rays to the lights in the scene.  Which combined with camera
//     jitter and accumulation (from prior tutorials), this gives alias-free shadows without
//     the standard problems of shadow mapping.
