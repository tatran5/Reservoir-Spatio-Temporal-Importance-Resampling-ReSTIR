## Introduction

This is a team project implementing ReSTIR based on the [research paper](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2020-07_Spatiotemporal-reservoir-resampling/ReSTIR.pdf) with the same title, published by NVIDIA in 2020. Briefly, the purpose of ReSTIR is to help rendering scenes with a lot of lights but make it much less noisy than the basic path tracing algorithm. This is a result of continuously finding and updating the most ideal light for a pixel based on its surrounding neighbor pixels and its light in previous frames.
