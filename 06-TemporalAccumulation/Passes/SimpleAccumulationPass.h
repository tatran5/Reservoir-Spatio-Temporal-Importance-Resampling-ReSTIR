// This class takes as input a shader buffer to accumulate from.  This buffer is copied
//     into an internal resource and every frame is updated to accumulate the current
//     frame with prior frames, the the accumulated frame is output back to overwrite the
//     input.  On camera motion (and UI changes in other passes), this accumulated result
//     is cleared.
