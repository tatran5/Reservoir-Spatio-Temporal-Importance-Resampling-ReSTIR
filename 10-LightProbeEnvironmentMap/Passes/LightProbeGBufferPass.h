// This pass takes the ray traced "ThinLensGBufferPass" from Tutorial #8 and also allows rays to hit
//    a background that may be an environment map light probe.  (This requires a bit of care, as this
//    pass does not write directly to the output.  Instead, the environment map colors are put into
//    the diffuse material entry in the G-buffer, and subsequent passes can copy this background color
//    through.)  The key points to note in this pass are (a) how to load an environment map on the C++
//    side using our framework and (b) the updated DXR miss shader that allows indexing into this texture.
